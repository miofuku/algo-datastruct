# The Ignorant Schoolmaster

The Ignorant Schoolmaster AI is an innovative educational platform inspired by Jacques Rancière's philosophy of intellectual emancipation. This system aims to empower students in their self-directed learning journey, promoting autonomy, critical thinking, and peer collaboration. Unlike traditional AI tutors, this platform serves as a facilitator rather than an instructor, encouraging students to construct their own understanding.
## Core Principles

- Promote student autonomy and self-discovery
- Emphasize equality of intelligence among all learners
- Focus on will and attention rather than knowledge transfer
- Encourage peer learning and teaching
- Position AI as a tool for emancipation, not as a knowledgeable master

## Key Features

- **Universal Book Repository**: A diverse digital library for free exploration
- **Question Generator**: AI-powered tool for thought-provoking inquiries
- **Peer Collaboration Platform**: Facilitates student-to-student learning
- **Progress Tracker**: For self-set goals and reflection
- **AI Facilitator**: Minimal guidance to maintain engagement
- **Open-Ended Knowledge Map**: Student-generated concept connections

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/miofuku/ig-schoolmaster.git
   cd ig-schoolmaster
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application with trained model:
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```
   
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
