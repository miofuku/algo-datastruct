# The Ignorant Schoolmaster

The Ignorant Schoolmaster AI is an innovative educational platform inspired by Jacques Rancière's philosophy of intellectual emancipation. Unlike traditional AI tutors, this system aims to empower students in their self-directed learning journey, promoting autonomy, critical thinking, and peer collaboration.

## Core Principles

- Promote student autonomy and self-discovery
- Emphasize equality of intelligence among all learners
- Focus on will and attention rather than knowledge transfer
- Encourage peer learning and teaching
- Position AI as a tool for emancipation, not as a knowledgeable master

## Key Features

- **Universal Book Repository**: A diverse digital library for free exploration
- **Question Generator**: AI-powered tool for thought-provoking inquiries
- **Peer Collaboration Platform**: Facilitates student-to-student learning
- **Progress Tracker**: For self-set goals and reflection
- **AI Facilitator**: Minimal guidance to maintain engagement
- **Open-Ended Knowledge Map**: Student-generated concept connections
