# The Ignorant Schoolmaster

The Ignorant Schoolmaster is an AI-powered virtual teaching assistant inspired by [Jacques Ranci√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ranci%C3%A8re)'s book of the same name. This project aims to create a personalized learning experience by combining the power of large language models with knowledge graphs and adaptive learning techniques.

## Features

- GPT-Neo-based language model for natural conversations
- Knowledge graph integration for concept relationships
- Personalized tutoring based on individual learning pace and style
- Continuous learning and adaptation through user feedback
- Additional information and learning path suggestions
